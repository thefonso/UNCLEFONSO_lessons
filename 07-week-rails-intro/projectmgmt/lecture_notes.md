# Agile Software Development Process

###How are teams broken up? What is the role of each person?
	
- The Frontend developer - Develops what the user sees. Interface and design.
- The Backend developer - Provides a base for the front end developer to build upon. 
- Designer - Will design the appearance of the product.
- Development manager-Similar to the project manager, but works closely with the dev team.
- UI / UX - Designs User Interface & User Experience, will work closely with front end and design teams
- The QA tester - Checks code, often by using the software as a user would and creates bug reports for developers.
 -Development Operations (Dev Ops) – after code has been signed off on by QA and is relatively bug-free, these people deploy this software to production, pushing it to a server making it available via the Internet; usually system administrators
- Project manager - Manages resources and time.
- Product manager - Takes control of the product, decides on the features to build.
- Database Analyst - Works with the database.
- DevOps - Works with deployment cycles, deployment strategies/migrations, optimization between code and server infrastructure
- Server Operations/IT - Keeps physical and software of server installations running smoothly. 

For students' projects, they should make sure that between their group members they are covering all of the relevant roles. Some people may have to take on multiple roles (ie the Front-end developer will probably also do the UI/UX and design in this case).

### Agile vs Waterfall

**Waterfall development method**

In the old days, software requirements were specified in a big book that took awhile to create, and then these specs went to the developers. This is an inefficient way to develop software, because you cannot possibly know ahead of time everything that will be needed. This process is called waterfall.

* Requirements -  Requirements for the project are set, these will outline the project but are not specific.
* Functional Specification- This is a more detailed version of the requirements which will go into depth.
* Detailed design document.-Tells the developers what they are using and how to use it.
* Coding -  Can eventually begin after everything else has been set in stone.

**Agile development method**

The agile development process takes an iterative approach. A requirement is set, it is implemented, tested, and refactored.This cycle is repeated until the product is complete. This is a much more flexible approach. Requirements are constantly being created and developers respond quickly to them.

###What is a daily stand up and how do you run one?
The daily scrum/stand-up will allow each member of the team to take 2 minutes to reflect on their progress, their blockers and where they intend to go next. Each person lets everyone know what they accomplished the previous day and what they will be working on today. In addition, there is a weekly sprint review meeting to go over what is working with the process and what can be improved.

### Intro to Pivotal Tracker

There are six steps for using this system:

1. Gathering Requirements – What do you want this product to do? These are non-technical and each fit on a 3.5 index card. The Product Owner creates these.

2. Create Stories from Requirements – Break the requirements down into small, discrete tasks or features, such as: As a user, I should be able to log in. The Product Owner does this.

3. Estimation – How hard are these tasks and how long will they take? The developers determine this, based on the difficulty. Each story is assigned points, using 1, 2, 3, for easy, medium, difficult (an hour, a few hours, half a day). Generally, if something is bigger than this scale, it needs to be further broken down. Zero is also an option, and can be used for clean-up tasks instead of features (see Chores under Story Types below)

4. Prioritization – How should these tasks be prioritized? The Product Owner determines prioritization.

5. Build Software – The dev team works on the stories. Includes UI/UX.

6. Acceptance? – Who decides that a story/task is complete? The Product Owner, with input from the dev team, QA, and others accepts or rejects the task. If rejected, it goes back to Step 5, or even Step 4 for re-prioritization. If accepted, the feature is deployed to production.


### Creating a Sample Pivotal Tracker Project

Students should Log in to Pivotal Tracker. We’ll go through a mock example of how a project is managed using this system.

Work with the class to create a Pivotal Tracker project for a Facebook clone. Start by creating a project from the dashboard. Use the Add Story button to open a new window. 

1. Gather requirements from the class. What do they want the product to do?
2. Pick a few of the requirements and begin breaking them down into user stories.
	* Use the INVEST mnemonic to make sure you are writing good user stories. Read more [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic\))
3. Estimate how long each of those stories will take. While you are estimating, talk aloud through your thought process and reasoning.
4. Prioritize the stories, talking through your rationale.

### Project 2 requirements and rubric

* The requirements and rubric are located [here](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/WDI_Curriculum/tree/design_lab/Project_Descriptions/2nd_Project)
* Review project 2 requirements with the class & how they will be evaluated
* Choose/assign groups for projects

### Idea Generation
* In their groups, students should brainstorm and decide on an idea
* Students should define their roles within their groups groups
* Instructors should vet all ideas to make sure they are the right scope

### Project 2 Planning
* Students should create a Pivotal Tracker project for their Project and
* Create user stories for group projects using Pivotal Tracker
* Set up backlog for the project
