# THIS is intro to RAILS-MVC

PREQ:

Students should have finished Sinatra and are ready for a one model rails app

Step 1 - Read the [intro to postgress with rails.md](intro_to_postgress_with_rails.md) file.

Step 2 - Watch my **rails in 60-minutes** video
(Students can follow the video and build a basic blog website app.)

Video covers:

- Scaffolds
- Generators
- Routes, Controllers and Views
- ActiveRecord Associations
- Form helpers
- Partials
- Basic Authentication



Extra credit: build out with custom css. Deploy it to heroku. Send me your link and I'll post it.
