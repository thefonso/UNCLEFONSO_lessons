### Type: 
- Group Lab

### Time Required: 
- 30 minutes

### Prerequisites:
- Ruby
    - Loops

    - rand()

### Objectives:
- Practice taking user input and a loop

### Activity:
- Students should work on this lab in groups.
- Students should be given `guess_the_number-prompt.rb` as a starting point, with `guess_the_number-solution.rb` as the ideal coded solution

### Explanation
- You are to generate a basic "guess my number" game.  The computer will pick a random number between 0 and 10.  The user will guess the number until they guess correctly.

### Specification:
- The user should be asked to guess a number
- If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message
- If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be asked to guess the number again.

### Post-mortem:
