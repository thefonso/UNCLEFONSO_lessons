# Modules are just like classes in that they contain methods. But
# unlike classes, you can't instantiate them. Instead, we include
# their methods in some other class, and then its instances get
# the module's methods.

# A class can only inherit from one other class, but it can include
# as many modules as it likes (this is commonly called a mixin)

# Because of this, mixing modules in is usually
# preferred in Ruby, rather than subclassing.
