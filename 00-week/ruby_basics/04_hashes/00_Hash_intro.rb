# Hash - intro

# First let's have a chat...
# 
# What are data structures?
# In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data 
# in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Different kinds of data structures are 
# suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.
# 
# Arrays and Hashes are two primary data structures used in Ruby. 
# (others include: map, Struct, set, Matrix, Vector)
# 
# Today we’ll talk about the Hash...

 # So what is a Hash?
 #   A hash is a type of data structure that lets you store things in a table of key / value pairs…like so
 #  
   hash = {
     key1 => value1,
     key2 => value2,
     key3 => value3
   }
