# Classes, Objects, and Inheritance

### Prereqs
- Data types
- Methods

### What are Classes and Objects (Learning Objectives)
- Articulate the value of using objects in programming
- Write classes with:
	- Attributes
	- Instance variables
	- Initialize method, and other methods relevant to the object
- Initialize a new class and perform actions on/with it

#### Points To Ponder

There are lots of moving parts as one builds out a class, and multiple classes.  Code organization is important, as is understanding the flow of data and variable context.

- What are objects and classes?
- Describe Procedural vs OOP
- Why would you use them?
- what is basic syntax of creating a class?
- what is the importance of each:
	- Attributes
	- methods
	- .new and initialization
	- attr_accessor
- What is inheritance?
- What does a class inherit?
- `class-inheritance.rb` has some examples of defining classes, and basic inheritance
- What is relationship between a class method and an instance method?
- If Pry has been introduced, demonstrate how to use pry to dig into classes, explore methods, and debug
- The `labs` folder contains a variety of labs and homeworks to help practice and familiarize the concepts



### Why Objects and Classes?
- Classes are a critical component of OOP, and OOP is a fundamental component of building larger apps, particularly in rails.
