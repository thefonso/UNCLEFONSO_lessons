# Title: Smoothies

### Type:
- Lab

### Time Required: 
- 30 minutes

### Prerequisites:
- Ruby
- Hashes & Arrays
- Blocks
- OOP

### Objectives:
- Exercise working with arrays, strings, and a basic object

### Activity:
- Students can work on this lab individually or groups of 2

### Explanation
- Given a hash of ingredients, write a function called `blend`.
	- It should take all the smoothie ingredients (not the measurements) and chop up and mix all the characters and output a mixed string of characters
	- Be sure to remove the spaces, as we don't want any air bubbles in our smoothie!
- Create a class called `Blender`
	- It should have a method that takes an array of ingredients and returns a mixed string of characters (`blend`).
	- Give the blender an on and off switch and only allow the blender to function when it's on.
	- FOR SAFETY'S SAKE When you create a new blender by default it should be off.
	- Blend the the smoothie array
