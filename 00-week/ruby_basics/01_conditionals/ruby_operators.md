# Ruby Operators

* * *

Ruby supports a rich set of operators, as you'd expect from a modern language. Most operators are actually method calls. For example, a + b is interpreted as a.+(b), where the + method in the object referred to by variable a is called with b as its argument.

For each operator (+ - * / % ** & | ^ << >> && ||), there is a corresponding form of abbreviated assignment operator (+= -= etc.)

## Ruby Arithmetic Operators:

Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| + | Addition - Adds values on either side of the operator | a + b will give 30 |
| - | Subtraction - Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand | a - b will give -10 |
| * | Multiplication - Multiplies values on either side of the operator | a * b will give 200 |
| / | Division - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand | b / a will give 2 |
| % | Modulus - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder | b % a will give 0 |
| ** | Exponent - Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators | a**b will give 10 to the power 20 |

## Ruby Comparison Operators:

Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| == | Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true. | (a == b) is not true. |
| != | Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. | (a != b) is true. |
| > | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (a > b) is not true. |
| < | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (a < b) is true. |
| >= | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (a >= b) is not true. |
| <= | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. | (a <= b) is true. |
| <=> | Combined comparison operator. Returns 0 if first operand equals second, 1 if first operand is greater than the second and -1 if first operand is less than the second. | (a <=> b) returns -1\. |
| === | Used to test equality within a when clause of a _case_ statement. | (1...10) === 5 returns true. |
| **.eql?** | True if the receiver and argument have both the same type and equal values. | 1 == 1.0 returns true, but 1**.eql?**(1.0) is false. |
| **equal?** | True if the receiver and argument have the same object id. | if aObj is duplicate of bObj then aObj == bObj is true, a**.equal?**bObj is false but a**.equal?**aObj is true. |

## Ruby Assignment Operators:

Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| = | Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand | c = a + b will assigne value of a + b into c |
| += | Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand | c += a is equivalent to c = c + a |
| -= | Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand | c -= a is equivalent to c = c - a |
| *= | Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand | c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a |
| /= | Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand | c /= a is equivalent to c = c / a |
| %= | Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand | c %= a is equivalent to c = c % a |
| **= | Exponent AND assignment operator, Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand | c **= a is equivalent to c = c ** a |

## Ruby Parallel Assignment:

Ruby also supports the parallel assignment of variables. This enables multiple variables to be initialized with a single line of Ruby code. For example:

```
a =  10 b =  20 c =  30
```

may be more quickly declared using parallel assignment:

```
a, b, c =  10,  20,  30
```

Parallel assignment is also useful for swapping the values held in two variables:

```
a, b = b, c
```

## Ruby Bitwise Operators:

Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit by bit operation.

Assume if a = 60; and b = 13; now in binary format they will be as follows:

a = 0011 1100

b = 0000 1101

-----------------

a&b = 0000 1100

a|b = 0011 1101

a^b = 0011 0001

~aÂ  = 1100 0011

There are following Bitwise operators supported by Ruby language


| Operator | Description | Example |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| & | Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands. | (a & b) will give 12, which is 0000 1100 |
| | | Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand. | (a | b) will give 61, which is 0011 1101 |
| ^ | Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both. | (a ^ b) will give 49, which is 0011 0001 |
| ~ | Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits. | (~a ) will give -61, which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number. |
| << | Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand. | a << 2 will give 240, which is 1111 0000 |
| >> | Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. | a >> 2 will give 15, which is 0000 1111 |


## Ruby Logical Operators:

There are following logical operators supported by Ruby language

Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| and | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true. | (a and b) is true. |
| or | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non zero, then the condition becomes true. | (a or b) is true. |
| && | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero, then the condition becomes true. | (a && b) is true. |
| || | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non zero, then the condition becomes true. | (a || b) is true. |
| ! | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false. | !(a && b) is false. |
| not | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false. | not(a && b) is false. |

## Ruby Ternary operator:

There is one more operator called Ternary Operator. This first evaluates an expression for a true or false value and then execute one of the two given statements depending upon the result of the evaluation. The conditional operator has this syntax:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| ? : | Conditional Expression | If Condition is true ? Then value X : Otherwise value Y |

## Ruby Range operators:

Sequence ranges in Ruby are used to create a range of successive values - consisting of a start value, an end value and a range of values in between.

In Ruby, these sequences are created using the ".." and "..." range operators. The two-dot form creates an inclusive range, while the three-dot form creates a range that excludes the specified high value.


| Operator | Description | Example |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| .. | Creates a range from start point to end point inclusive | 1..10 Creates a range from 1 to 10 inclusive |
| ... | Creates a range from start point to end point exclusive | 1...10 Creates a range from 1 to 9 |

## Ruby defined? operators:

defined? is a special operator that takes the form of a method call to determine whether or not the passed expression is defined. It returns a description string of the expression, or _nil_ if the expression isn't defined.

There are various usage of defined? operator:

## Usage 1

```
defined? variable # True if variable is initialized
```

For Example:

```
foo = 42
defined? foo    # => "local-variable"
defined? $_     # => "global-variable"
defined? bar    # => nil (undefined)
```

## Usage 2

```
defined? method_call # True if a method is defined
```

For Example:

```
defined? puts        # => "method"
defined? puts(bar)   # => nil (bar is not defined here)
defined? unpack      # => nil (not defined here)
```

## Usage 3

```
# True if a method exists that can be called with super user
defined? super
```

For Example:

```
defined? super     # => "super" (if it can be called)
defined? super     # => nil (if it cannot be)
```

## Usage 4

```
defined? yield   # True if a code block has been passed
```

For Example:

```
defined? yield    # => "yield" (if there is a block passed)
defined? yield    # => nil (if there is no block)
```

## Ruby dot "." and double Colon "::" Operators:

You call a module method by preceding its name with the module's name and a period, and you reference a constant using the module name and two colons.

The **::** is a unary operator that allows: constants, instance methods and class methods defined within a class or module, to be accessed from anywhere outside the class or module.

**Remember:** in Ruby, classes and methods may be considered constants too.

You need just to prefix the **::** Const_name with an expression that returns the appropriate class or module object.

If no prefix expression is used, the main Object class is used by default.

Here are two examples:

```
MR_COUNT = 0        # constant defined on main Object class
module Foo
  MR_COUNT = 0
  ::MR_COUNT = 1    # set global count to 1
  MR_COUNT = 2      # set local count to 2
end
puts MR_COUNT       # this is the global constant
puts Foo::MR_COUNT  # this is the local "Foo" constant
```

Second Example:

```
CONST = ' out there'
class Inside_one
   CONST = proc {' in there'}
   def where_is_my_CONST
      ::CONST + ' inside one'
   end
end
class Inside_two
   CONST = ' inside two'
   def where_is_my_CONST
      CONST
   end
end
puts Inside_one.new.where_is_my_CONST
puts Inside_two.new.where_is_my_CONST
puts Object::CONST + Inside_two::CONST
puts Inside_two::CONST + CONST
puts Inside_one::CONST
puts Inside_one::CONST.call + Inside_two::CONST
```
