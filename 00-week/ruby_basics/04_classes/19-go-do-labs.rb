# Okay, we made it through :)
# Now you just need to go do the challenges
# 
# Open up the labs in your text editor.

# !!!!!!!!!!DON'T FORGET!!!!!!!!!
# There are cheatsheets to help you. You will need to reference them!
#
# How should you use the cheatsheets?
# Read them once so you know what kinds of things they contain.
# 
# You don't need to sit down and try to memorize the whole sheet (if you want to, you can)
# It's mostly important to know what general things they contain, and begin to memorize
# the parts that you use frequently.
