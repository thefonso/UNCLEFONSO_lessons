# Okay, we made it through :)
# Now you just need to go do the challenges
# 
# Open up the challenges in your text editor. Try to complete the first one.
# Then go to the terminal, and navigate to the lab folder
# Then run $ rspec spec/1.rb

# note: you may need to ...
# gem install rspec
# rspec --init

# Did you pass? No? 
# Okay, look at the output and try again. See what went wrong? 
# Try again!
# 
# Did you pass? Yeah? 
# Great! No go finish the rest :D

# !!!!!!!!!!DON'T FORGET!!!!!!!!!
# There are cheatsheets to help you. You will need to reference them!
#
# How should you use the cheatsheets?
# Read them once so you know what kinds of things they contain.
# 
# You don't need to sit down and try to memorize the whole sheet (if you want to, you can)
# It's mostly important to know what general things they contain, and begin to memorize
# the parts that you use frequently.
