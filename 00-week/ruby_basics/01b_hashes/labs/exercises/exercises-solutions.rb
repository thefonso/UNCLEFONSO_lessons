# 1. How would you return the string `"Erik"`?
a[1]

# 2. How would you add your name to the array?

### B. Given the following data structure:
h = {0 => "Zero", 1 => "One", :two => "Two", "two" => 2}


# 1. How would you return the string `"One"`?
h[1]

# 2. How would you return the string `"Two"`?
h[:two]

# 3. How would you return the number `2`?
h["two"]

# 4. How would you add `{3 => "Three"}` to the hash?
h[3] = "Three"

# 5. How would you add `{:four => 4}` to the hash?
h[:four] = 4



### C. Given the following data structure:
is = {true => "It's true!", false => "It's false"}


# 1. What is the return value of `is[2 + 2 == 4]`?
"It's true!"

# 2. What is the return value of `is["Erik" == "Jonathan"]`?
"It's false"

# 3. What is the return value of `is[9 > 10]`?
"It's false"

# 4. What is the return value of `is[0]`?
nil

# 5. What is the return value of `is["Erik"]`?
nil



### D. Given the following data structure:
users = {
  "Jonathan" => {
    :twitter => "tronathan",
    :favorite_numbers => [12, 42, 75],
  },
  "Erik" => {
    :twitter => "sferik",
    :favorite_numbers => [8, 12, 24],
  },
  "Anil" => {
    :twitter => "bridgpal",
    :favorite_numbers => [12, 14, 85],
  }
}


# 1. How would you access Jonathan's Twitter handle (i.e. the string `"tronathan"`)?
users["Jonathan"][:twitter]

# 2. How would you add the number `7` to Erik's favorite numbers?
users["Erik"][:favorite_numbers] << 7

# 3. How would you add yourself to the users hash?
users["Clayton"] = {}

# 4. How would you return the array of Erik's favorite numbers?
users["Erik"][:favorite_numbers]

# 5. How would you return the smallest of Erik's favorite numbers?
users["Erik"][:favorite_numbers].min

# 6. How would you return an array of Anil's favorite numbers that are also even?
users["Anil"][:favorite_numbers].select { |n| n if n.even? }

# 7. How would you return an array of the favorite numbers common to all users?
users["Jonathan"][:favorite_numbers] & users["Erik"][:favorite_numbers] & users["Anil"][:favorite_numbers]

# 8. How would you return an array containing all users' favorite numbers, sorted, and excluding duplicates?
