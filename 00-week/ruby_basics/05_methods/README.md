# Methods

### Prereqs
- Data types
- Conditions
- Loops


### Points to Ponder
- In Ruby, are functions and methods the same thing?
- What does a method contain?
- How do you define a method?
- How do you call a method?
- What are method arguments?
- What is Variable Scope?


### Labs 
- `prompts` involves rewriting the code from `conditionals_lab` into methods
- `ruby_calculator` requirements are listed step-by-step, the student will fill in the necessary code along the way.


### Why Methods?
- Now we can introduce the concepts of "DRY code" and begin organizing our code better
