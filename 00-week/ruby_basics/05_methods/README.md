#Methods

###Prereqs
- Data types
- Conditions
- Loops


###Points to Ponder
- In Ruby, are functions and methods the same thing?
- What does a method contain?
- How do you define a method?
- How do you call a method?
- What are method arguments?
- What is Variable Scope?


### Demo
- demo: `prompts` involves rewriting the code from `conditionals_lab` into functions
- Codealong: `ruby_calculator`
  - instructor will walkthrough the requirements step-by-step as the students fill in the necessary code along the way.


###Why Methods?
- Now we can introduce the concepts of "DRY code" and begin organizing our code better
