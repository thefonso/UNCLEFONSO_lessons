#Ruby Basics: loops

###Prereqs
- strings
- conditionals
- arays
- hashes


###Points To Ponder

Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment

* WHILE executes code _____ condition is true?
* UNTIL executes code _____ condition is true?
* what did Maz say about `begin ... end`?
* what does `break` do?
* what is `next`?

###Why loops?
- because you need 'em. next up `methods`
