# Origins of the Ruby Language:
#   Written By: Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto)

#
#   All programing languages adhere to one or many programming Paradigms.
#
#   Ruby is a multi-paradigm language:
#
#   What does that mean? 
#
#   Paradigms:
#
#     1.Imperative - 'first do this, next do that' is a short phrase which in a nutshell describes the imperative paradigm. 
#     The phrase also reflects that the order of the commands is important. 'First do that, then do this' would be different 
#     from 'first do this, then do that'.
#
#     2.Functional - Evaluate an expression and use the resulting value for something.
#
#     3.Object-Oriented - Send messages between objects to simulate real world phenomena 
#     (In Ruby, except for some operators, _everything_ is an object).
#
#     4.Reflective - reflection is the ability of a computer program to examine and modify the structure and behavior of the
#     program at runtime. 
#
#     We will get into each of these later on
