# Remember when we told you that everything is an object in Ruby? Well, we sort of fibbed. 
# Blocks are not objects, and this is one of the very few exceptions to the "everything is an object" rule in Ruby.

# Because of this, blocks can't be saved to variables and don't have all the powers and abilities of a real object. 
# For that, we'll need... procs!

# You can think of a proc as a "saved" block: just like you can give a bit of code a name and turn it into a method, 
# you can name a block and turn it into a proc. Procs are great for keeping your code DRY, 
# which stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. With blocks, you have to write your code out each time you need it; 
# with a proc, you write your code once and can use it many times!

multiples_of_3 = Proc.new do |n|
  n % 3 == 0
