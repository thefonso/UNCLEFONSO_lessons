## Homework Assignment
Create a linked list in Ruby that implements the following methods:

first (returns the data in the first node)
last (returns the data in the last node)
empty? (returns true if there are no nodes in the list)
size (returns the size of the list)
each (interates over the data in each node)
[] (a.k.a. slice) (returns the data in the node at a particular zero-based index)
[]= (overwrite the data in the node at a particular zero-based index)
push (a.k.a. <<) (adds a node to the end of the list and returns the list)
pop (removes the last node and returns the data in that node)
shift (removes the first node and returns the data in that node)
unshift (adds a node to the beginning of the list and returns the list)
select, reject, collect, inject (Enumerable)
Write tests for every method (100% C0 code coverage) and benchmarks to prove that insertion/deletion is happens in O(1) (a.k.a. constant time) and traversal happens in O(n) (a.k.a. linear time).

Bonus
Extend your singly-linked list to be a doubly-linked list and add implement the following methods:

reverse_each (iterates over the data in reverse)
delete_at (deletes the node at the specified index and returns the data in that node without breaking the link between the next and previous node)
reimplement [] (a.k.a slice) and []= to be more efficient

## Homework Assignment

Read the attached research paper "The First Level of Super Mario Bros. is Easy with Lexicographic Orderings and Time Travel…after that it gets a little tricky" by Dr. Tom Murphy VII.

Write a function (with specs and benchmarks) that sorts an Array in Ruby.

Bonus
Write a function that (with specs and benchmarks) that sorts a (singly or doubly) Linked List in Ruby.

Double Bonus
Listen to episode four of "Real Talk", a highly technical and unedited podcast by James Golick and Joe Damato.

## Homework Assignment

Read "If you aren’t getting rejected on a daily basis, your goals aren’t ambitious enough" by Chris Dixon. It’s only 3 paragraphs so no excuses.

Prepare an answer to the interview question "So, tell me about yourself?" for your dream job. It should contain:

Drive statement (e.g. "I love animals")
Credentials (e.g. three facts about yourself)
Statement of interest in the company/role
Also, next week is the final project week. Be prepared to hit the ground running. You should have a clear vision of what you want to build, wireframes for each screen, the data model figured out, etc. There should be no blockers to begin coding on Monday morning. Feel free to start coding this weekend if you want to get a head start.
