WEEK 11 - Computer Science
========

Taking a departure from web-based programming and rails, Week 11 presents the conceptual fundamentals of Computer Science as a subject.

An important think to keep in mind during this week is preparing the students to answer CS-related interview questions.  Another important focus is sparking student curiosity and developing problem solving skills.  Topics dive "under-the-hood" of programming concepts and are intended to help students understand why and how things work the way they do.

Framing for this week: A lot of this stuff is preparation for common job interview questions. Some of it is less practical, in the sense that you won't be using it every day, but it's pramagic to teach, since it may be necessary to get a job. The big goal is give students exposure to and intuition about "hard" problems/concepts.

- Trees
- Graphs
- Garbage collection
- VMs, bytecode, machine code, etc.
