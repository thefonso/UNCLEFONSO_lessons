###Morning

Why: A computer science review.  A lot of this stuff is preparation for common job interview questions. Some of it is less practical, in the sense that you won't be using it every day, but it's pragmagic to teach, since it may be necessary to get a job or debug a problem. The big goal is give students exposure to and intuition about "hard" problems/concepts.

Students should cover these topics:

- Computers only do what we tell them to do
- VM, data types & structures, shallow/deep reference
- Garbage collection
- logic, code, loops
- Algorithms
- [Code Smell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell)
- SOLID/ACID

###Afternoon

Students should 
- BigO & time complexity of algorithms
- Verify with profiler

###HW

- Implement HEX
- Project Euler
