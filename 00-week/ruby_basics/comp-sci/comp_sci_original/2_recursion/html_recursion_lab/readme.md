- Type: Code Along/Group Project

- Class: WDI

- Version: 0.1

**Estimated Type:** 3 hours

###Summary

This is a second look at recursion, to follow up an initial introduction to the concept. It should take one morning or afternoon session, and is a partial code-along demonstration and transitions into a group project. The objectives are to reinforce the idea of recursion while introducing the HTML5 canvas.

**Prerequisites:**

- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

###Notes

This is a difficult lab, but the visual feedback aspect is really interesting and students generally seem to like it -- it helps to break up the less visual Computer Science code-alongs.
