### Instructional Component

Start out by having students make a very simply recursive function (your choice, we did a rocket countdown), and let it go infinite. At this point, talk about the need for not only a recursive case but also a base case. Fix the recursive function/method to work. Pat everyone on the back.

Next, talk about factorial method and have the students code it (pseudo code it first if they seem lost). Then do the same with the fibonacci sequence.

Using the Ruby Profiler, show the run time and number of calls to each method. Show how the fibonacci method can be done using loops instead of recursion and how much faster it is and how many fewer calls it's doing. This is a downside of recursion!

But talk about the benefits of recursion -- most branching recursion cannot be done with loops -- this is a good time to go over linear vs. branching recursion if you haven't already.
