### Instructional Component

In this lab, the instructor should begin by talking about binary trees and going over how the binary decision trees are different from binary search trees (nodes are not ordered in a comparable way). The instructor does a code-along/discussion to set up the BinaryTree class, the get_yes_no method and the is_answer method.

Then the instructor prompts the students to help pseudo-code the play_game method.

Students break up into group of three to build the play_game function (takes up to an hour), utilizing the pseudo-code.

In this game, the computer begins with a decision tree, the top nodes of which are questions and the bottom nodes of which are answers. The computer asks Y/N questions until it gets to the end of a branch, at which point it makes a guess. If it is correct, the game is over and a rematch challenge is issued. If it is incorrect, things get interesting -- the computer asks what the user was thinking of and what question they should have asked, and adds those two nodes to the tree -- learning on the fly.

### The Why

Binary decision trees are a data structure with uses in statistics, data mining and machine learning, as a predictive model.
