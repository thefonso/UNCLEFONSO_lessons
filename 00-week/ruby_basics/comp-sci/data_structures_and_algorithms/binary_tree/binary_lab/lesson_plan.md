Talk about the concept of Binary Trees and diagram a few on the board.

As a code-along, implement a Binary Tree class in Ruby. Then, talk about the idea of a Binary Search Tree -- same structure but with rules about where nodes can be placed. Make a Binary Search Tree class that inherits from the BinaryTree class, then have students pseudo-code the `.insert` method of the Binary Search Tree class.

In groups of 2-3, they switch into lab mode and complete the insert class. Make sure that they are drawing the structures they expect.

Next up is the `.search` method -- have the class come back together to talk about it, diagram it and pseudo-code it, then split into groups of 2-3 again to code it .
