###Basic Recursion
- Name: Basic Recurrsion

- Type: Lab

- Class: WDI

- Version: 0.1

- Original Source:  [Basic-Recursion](https://github.com/doshea/basic_recursion)

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

###Summary

This module is rather short and needs something added to it at the end to make students use recursion more. The objective is to introduce students to recursion and talk about its pros and cons, particularly its "effects" on the call stack (it gets enormous).

**Prerequisites:**

- Ruby
- [Ruby Profiler](https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof)

###Resources

- [Recursive Fuction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))
- [Factorial Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)
- [Fibonacci Sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_Sequence)

###Notes

This module is INCOMPLETE, as it was done in about 2-2.5 hours the first time -- add additional recursion exercises (Project Euler problems?)
