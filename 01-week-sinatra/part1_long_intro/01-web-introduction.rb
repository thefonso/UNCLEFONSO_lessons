# Ok so on the internet computers are like shipping piers ok? Go with me on this.
# Every pier has a specific address  In computer terms a pier's address is a series of 
# numbers like so 172.217.5.196 (ip address) 
#
# Every pier has many ports on it. Like many piers, similar things are available at similar ports
# And these over time have become standards on the web
# One such port is port 80 where most web traffic occurs.
#
# Your web application will use a program called a server to watch
# a port for incoming data. The server will take the data, and
# provide it to your application in a way that your application
# can do something with it.
