# Okay, lets take a Sinatra application and put it on Heroku.


# Go get an account at heroku.com

# We will do this live:
#   put under source control with git
#   Create the Gemfile
#   install the gems
#   show that it works in the browser
#   create a view for our cat page
#   make sure everything is committed
#   create our Heroku app `$ heroku create`
#     The first time you do this, you'll have to authenticate yourself
#     I won't because I've done it before
#     Heroku will add itself as a remote repository to your git repo
#   Push the repo to Heroku with `$ git push heroku master`
#   Now open the site with `$ heroku open`
