#File IO

###Prereqs
- Ruby
- Arrays

###Eye OH? (Learning Objectives)
- Write and Save to files
- Think about loading up data
- **This should prepare students for thinking about databases.**

###How to teach this topic
#####Suggested ways to introduce the topic
- start with an earlier address book or group sizes exercise. how to save it?

#####How to break it down
- build on an earlier example prompting users for input, entering class names
- the group exercise of splitting the class up. how to save that.
- set up the class one on ones file.
- start with writing data to a file
- move to retreiving data
- now instantiate objects

#####Potential questions, difficulties, and problems
- Remembering to close files
- Writing to files that don't exist yet

###Why File IO?
- We've been writing programs that take input but that data doesn't persist.
This should illustrate that we can save data to a file, and later retrieve that data.
**This should prepare students for thinking about databases.**
- Retreiving information and instantiating objects from that data should help prepare students for ActiveRecord
