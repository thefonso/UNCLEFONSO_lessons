	<!-- Form elements and attributes in HTML5 provide a greater degree of semantic mark-up than HTML4 and remove a great deal of the need for tedious scripting and styling that was required in HTML4. The forms features in HTML5 provide a better experience for users by making forms more consistent across different web sites and giving immediate feedback to the user about data entry. They also provide this experience to users who have scripting disabled in their browser. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Forms_in_HTML -->
