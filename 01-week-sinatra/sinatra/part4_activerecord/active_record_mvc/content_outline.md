- ActiveRecord (Abstraction)
    - Query the same students table that you were querying with raw SQL
    - Show that it's easier
    - Rows in databases map to objects
    - Primary keys/Foreign keys create associations (has_many, belongs_to)
        - Student has many grades
        - Grade belong to student
    - Adding associations dynamically defines new methods on the class
        - Student.find_by_name("Erik").assignments
        - Assignment.first.student

    - Tradeoffs
    - [History](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/trygver/themes/mvc/mvc-index.html)
    - First applied to the web in ~2000
    - Relate to HTTP requests
    - Our templates are "views" (make analogy to CSS)
        - Again, logic doesn't go here
    - Models
        - These are Ruby classes
        - Logic goes here!
    - Lab/Homework
        - Build a simple CRUD application that allows you to create/retreive/update/delete students
