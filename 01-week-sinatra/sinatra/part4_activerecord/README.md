#Week 3: Sinatra MVC

###What did the class do last week?

Students should have a solid grasp of how servers and browsers make up the web,
and how the HTTP requests and responses send data back and forth. They should
also know the difference between the GET and POST request methods.

Students should be able to build a basic sinatra app to serve HTML and CSS,
respond to links, and submit the form data.

###Where should students be by the end of this week?

- Be able to use the basic data manipulation and definition commands in SQL
- SQL with foreign keys and join tables
- Use the ActiveRecord module for database abstraction
- Explain MVC separation of concerns and usage of each component
- Learn about bundler and use Gemfile
- Deploy to Heroku

### Sample Topic Flow

|  Time of Day  | Monday      | Tuesday    |Wednesday     |Thursday     |  Friday
| ------------- |:-----  |:-----|:-----|:-----  |:-------- |
| Morning       |SQL|SQL Foreign Keys & Joins| ActiveRecord and MVC|ActiveRecord with multiple models| Bundler, Gemfile, Heroku|
| Afternoon     |Hook up Sinatra with postgres and practice CRUD|Continue learning to create/drop tables and modify columns|include ActiveRecord, transition from pure SQL | ActiveRecord with multiple models|Deploy an app to Heroku|
| HW            |Do a CRUD app|Practice adding tables and changing columns|Make an MVC app||


Transitioning over from the end of last week where students learned file I/O, we start by continuing this idea of persistence by introducing SQL. After getting used to writing SQL queries, we introduce ActiveRecord. At this point, students are gradually building up a framework to understand MVC using Sinatra. At the end of the week, students should build an MVC app that is deployed to Heroku. This will gear them up for Rails next week.

###How does this connect to next week?

Next week is about Rails MVC, so introducing the various components separately and within the context of what student's learned in week 2 would make the concepts easier to focus on, without the distraction of having to learn a new framework.
