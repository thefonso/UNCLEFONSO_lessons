# Ok so computers are like shipping piers ok? Go with me on this.
# Every pier has a specific address, the port of Los Angeles for example.
# And every pier has many ports. Now for our discussion, let's pretend that 
# only one specific type of ship can dock at a specific port. So a ship comes
# from some other pier somewhere else in the world to dock at our pier here in LA.
# Now let's say we have Pier "google.com" at 172.217.5.196 
#
# This pier has many ports on it. Like many piers, it has similar things available at similar ports
# And these over time have become standards in the "shipping industry" of the web
# One such port is port 80 where most web traffic occurs.
#
# Your web application will use a program called a server to watch
# a port for incoming data. The server will take the data, and
# provide it to your application in a way that your application
# can do something with it.
