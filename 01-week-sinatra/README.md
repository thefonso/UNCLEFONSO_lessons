# Week 3: Sinatra MVC

### What did the class do last week?

Students should have a solid grasp of how servers and browsers make up the web,
and how the HTTP requests and responses send data back and forth. They should
also know the difference between the GET and POST request methods.

Students should be able to build a basic sinatra app to serve HTML and CSS,
respond to links, and submit the form data.

### Where should students be by the end of this week?

- Be able to use the basic data manipulation and definition commands in SQL
- SQL with foreign keys 
- Use the ActiveRecord module for database abstraction
- Explain MVC separation of concerns and usage of each component
- Learn about bundler and use Gemfile
- Deploy to Heroku

### How does this connect to next week?

Next week is about Rails MVC, so introducing the various components separately and within the context of what student's learned in week 2 would make the concepts easier to focus on, without the distraction of having to learn a new framework.
