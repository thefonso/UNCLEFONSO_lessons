#File IO

###Prereqs
- Ruby
- Arrays

###Learning Objectives
- Write and Save to files
- Think about loading up data
- **This should prepare you for thinking about databases.**


#####Break it down
- start with writing data to a file
- move to retreiving data
- instantiate objects

#####Potential questions, difficulties, and problems
- Remembering to close files
- Writing to files that don't exist yet

###Why File IO?
- We've been writing programs that take input but that data doesn't persist.
This should illustrate that we can save data to a file, and later retrieve that data.
- Retreiving information and instantiating objects from that data should help prepare you for ActiveRecord
