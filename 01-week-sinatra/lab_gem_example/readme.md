#How to run this activity
Have the students create a Sinatra app that renders a basic form with a text input. Make sure students understand the form action and method. You may have to walk through how to use the Yahoo Finance gem. From there, students should work on rendering all of the information on the page. Once they finish that, they can work on styling the page how they like.

Students should work individually to
* Create a webpage.
* Add a header and footer.
* Add a field for symbol with a submit button.
* Use the yahoofinance gem to print out the stock symbol and the current price.

##Objectives
Students should be able to integrate gems into their apps and be more familiar
with conditional logic in their views
