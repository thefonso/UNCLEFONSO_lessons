# Intro to Postgres and Rails

This file will show you how to install Postgres onto a Mac

- Students will be able to use postgres in a rails app
- open the postgres server command prompt
- install and use the pgadmin tool
- install postgres in a Rails app

## Installation:

### Step 1 - download the [postgresapp](http://postgresapp.com/)

control+click to install it in your applications folder

go to your terminal or iterm2 command line prompt and type...

	psql postgres
	
inside the postgres=# prompt type...

	CREATE EXTENSION "adminpack";
	
	CREATE ROLE rails WITH createdb login password 'rails';
	
then quit psql by typing...

	\q



### Step 2 - download and install [pgadmin3](http://www.pgadmin.org/download/macosx.php)

This is not necessary to make postgres work on your system. This is only here to provide you with a tool to view what is inside your database. NEVER use this tool to edit your database! Use rails migrations! Or you're gonna have a bad time :)


### Step 3 - create a new rails app

**New Rails4 app**

	$ rails _4.0.4_ new pgtestapp --database=postgresql
	
We'll do a little dirty scaffold to get our test app going.

	 $ rails generate scaffold Street name:string treetype:string
	 
edit **Database.yml**

```
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: pgtestapp_development
  pool: 5
  username: rails
  password: rails
```

then at your command prompt...

	rake db:create
	rake db:migrate
	
now open your app in chrome

	localhost:3000/street

You should see a working app with models! Enter in a few values.
	 
	NOTE: Don't forget to create a root page. Make sure you edit the routes.rb page and get your app pointing it's root to it!!
	
## YOU'RE DONE!

### below are some instructions for getting your app onto heroku...
	
**Heroku specific instructions:**

	NOTE: everything from below this point will be for getting your app ready for deployment onto Heroku.	

	
To enable features such as static asset serving and logging on Heroku add rails_12factor gem to the end of your Gemfile.

	gem 'rails_12factor', group: :production
	 
Specify specific Ruby. At the end of your gemfile add...

	ruby "2.1.2"
	
	
## Add Unicorn Webserver to your Gemfile:

Inside your gemfile

	gem 'unicorn'
	
Then run
	
	$ bundle install
	
Now you are ready to configure your app to use Unicorn.

Create a configuration file for Unicorn at config/unicorn.rb:

	$ touch config/unicorn.rb
	
Add Unicorn specific configuration options In file config/unicorn.rb:

```
worker_processes Integer(ENV["WEB_CONCURRENCY"] || 3)
timeout 15
preload_app true

before_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap 'TERM' do
    puts 'Unicorn master intercepting TERM and sending myself QUIT instead'
    Process.kill 'QUIT', Process.pid
  end

  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!
end

after_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap 'TERM' do
    puts 'Unicorn worker intercepting TERM and doing nothing. Wait for master to send QUIT'
  end

  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
end
```
This default configuration assumes a standard Rails app with Active Record. You should get acquainted with the different options in [the official Unicorn documentation](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html).

Finally you will need to tell Heroku how to run your Rails app by creating a Procfile in the root of your application directory.

##Add a Procfile:

	touch Procfile
	(note: the case is important!)
	
in the Procfile write:

	web: bundle exec unicorn -p $PORT -c ./config/unicorn.rb

Set the RACK_ENV to development in your environment and a PORT to connect to. Before pushing to Heroku you’ll want to test with the RACK_ENV set to production since this is the enviroment your Heroku app will run in.
	
	$ echo "RACK_ENV=development" >> .env
	$ echo "PORT=3000" >> .env
	
You’ll also want to add .env to your .gitignore since this is for local enviroment setup.

	$ echo ".env" >> .gitignore
	$ git add .gitignore
	$ git commit -m "add .env to .gitignore"
	
Test your Procfile locally using Foreman:

	$ gem install foreman

You can now start your web server by running

	$ foreman start
	18:24:56 web.1  | I, [2013-03-13T18:24:56.885046 #18793]  INFO -- : listening on addr=0.0.0.0:5000 fd=7
	18:24:56 web.1  | I, [2013-03-13T18:24:56.885140 #18793]  INFO -- : worker=0 spawning...
	18:24:56 web.1  | I, [2013-03-13T18:24:56.885680 #18793]  INFO -- : master process ready
	18:24:56 web.1  | I, [2013-03-13T18:24:56.886145 #18795]  INFO -- : worker=0 spawned pid=18795
	18:24:56 web.1  | I, [2013-03-13T18:24:56.886272 #18795]  INFO -- : Refreshing Gem list
	18:24:57 web.1  | I, [2013-03-13T18:24:57.647574 #18795]  INFO -- : worker=0 ready
	
Press Ctrl-C to exit and you can deploy your changes to Heroku:

	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "use unicorn via procfile"
	$ git push heroku master

Check ps, you’ll see the web process uses your new command specifying Unicorn as the web server

	$ heroku ps
	=== web (1X): `bundle exec unicorn -p $PORT -c ./config/unicorn.rb`
	web.1: starting 2014/04/17 12:55:33 (~ 1s ago)


	
At this point you can follow the normal procedure to get your app on heroku

```
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

get things set up on github....then

```
heroku create
git push heroku master
```

Migrate the database on Heroku

	heroku run rake db:migrate
	
make sure the app is set to run
	
	heroku ps:scale web=1
	
open the app

	heroku open
	

**Potential Questions**

Q - How do I get my mongo data over to my postgress Rails app

A - Make a data dump from mongohq

Q - Is there anything like genghisapp for postgress?

A - yes pgadmin3

Q - can I use pgadmin to modify my database?
A - Yes but if you do so ... you're gonna have a bad time...use migrations instead.
