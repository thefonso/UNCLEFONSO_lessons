I'll take you on a journey that starts you with basic HTML all the way to full blown advanced Rails application development and deployment.

Along the way, you will learn about javascript development so you can give your creations pizazz. We will seperate your content from it's presentation layer with databasses.

WHAT WILL YOU BUILD?<br>

we will start with an introduction to the Ruby language and then move to basic html and css. We will then build a simple single page javascript application that, over time, will evolve into a more advanced MEAN stack application incorporating javascript framework and database concepts. Finally we will build a full Rails application in a team environment.

**Some things we will build:**

0. Rock Paper Scissors
1. Tic-Tac-Toe SPA  
2. MEAN stack app
